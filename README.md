# Correctional Health Services Reports

In 2016, the Board of Corrections (BOC) required Health + Hospital's Correctional Health Services (CHS) produce an access report in order to monitor compliance with Minimum Standards on Health Care and Mental Health Care and identify strengths of the system as well as major barriers to care. 

In April 2016, CHS started producing monthly access reports using data from its electronic health records. The report monitors each month's approximately 55,000 scheduled health and mental health visits, 10,000 sick call visits, 4,000 health intakes, 600+ mental health referrals, and various other health encounters. The report looks at metrics at each of the twelve facilities and overall. Nationally, this is the most comprehensive real-time reporting on health and mental health care access in jails.
